# 🛡️ Donation Privacy System using Paillier Homomorphic Encryption

This is a privacy-preserving donation system that securely collects and aggregates encrypted donation values using Paillier Homomorphic Encryption algorithm. It ensures that individual donation amounts remain confidential. (**For demonstration purpose**, the administrator is allowed to see the decrypted total donation sum)

Built with:
- Python (Flask)
- SQLite
- `phe` library (Paillier encryption)
- HTML/CSS/JS for the interface

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔐 **Homomorphic Encryption**: Donations are encrypted on the client side before storage.
- 🧮 **Aggregate Computation**: Server decrypts only the **total donation** (for demonstration purpose), not individual values.
- 🧑‍💼 **Admin Dashboard**: Displays total donations and encrypted entries per donor.
- 🧾 **Multiple Donors**: Users can submit multiple donations under different names.
- 💾 **SQLite Database**: Lightweight, serverless data storage.
